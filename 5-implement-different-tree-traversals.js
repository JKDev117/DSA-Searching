/* 5. Implement different tree traversals
Using your BinarySearchTree class from your previous lesson, create a binary search tree with the following dataset:

25 15 50 10 24 35 70 4 12 18 31 44 66 90 22. Then implement inOrder(), preOrder(), and postOrder() functions.
Test your functions with the following datasets.

A pre-order traversal should give you the following order: 25, 15, 10, 4, 12, 24, 18, 22, 50, 35, 31, 44, 70, 66, 90

In-order: 4, 10, 12, 15, 18, 22, 24, 25, 31, 35, 44, 50, 66, 70, 90

Post-order: 4, 12, 10, 22, 18, 24, 15, 31, 44, 35, 66, 90, 70, 50, 25
